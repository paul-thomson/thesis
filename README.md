# Plan #
**boldface** text is still to be completed. Other text means it has been written/revised in some way though not necessarily complete.
## Introduction ##
* Briefly explain the general structure of the report, discuss the final outcomes

## Background ##
* Infandango and current feedback. Also talk about the course and gathered data
* **Machine learning to solve problems**
* **Literature**
	- Khan blog
	- Programming assessment
	- Edward Tufte summary 
	- **some machine learning paper about optimisation**

## Design ##
* Language and tools
* **Proposed Design**
	- Machine learning model
	- **Visualisation**
* **How it will integrate with Infandango**

## Choosing a model ##
* **Feature selection**
	- **do we retain question identity? Yes and no**
* **Preliminary models**
	- **Classifiers		}**
	- **Regression		} For both of these explain the libraries and model details**
* **Training and optimising**
	- **K-fold cross validation**
* **Results**
* **Conclusion**

## Implementation ##
* **Probably nothing on ML, that should mostly be covered**
* **CSS Design**
* **How it fits with Infandango**
* **Improvements**

## Conclusion ##
* **Stress the main acheivements:**
	- **a model that predicts the score**
	- **give the user more feedback, and it has been integrated and is working**
* **What could be done**
	- **Use different features**
	- **Tests**

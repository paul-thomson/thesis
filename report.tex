\title{Improving feedback for a web-based marking system}
\author{Paul Thomson\\Supervisor: Ewan Klein}
\abstract{This thesis will discuss the work done towards improving the feedback provided supplied to users of the Infandango system. By applying machine learning methods to submission data from a previous year a model is created which can provide a single score to the user, representing their progress so far. A discussion of the efficacy of different machine learning methods will provide reasons for choosing one model over the others. This will then be integrated with the Infandango system, providing a visual mechanism to display the score.}

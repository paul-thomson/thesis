\title{Improving feedback for a web-based marking system}
\author{Paul Thomson}
\abstract{This report discusses the work done towards improving the feedback supplied to users of the automated web-based marking system, Infandango. By applying machine learning methods to submission data recorded from students of a previous class, a model has been created which can predict a single score for the user which represents their progress so far. Through processes of optimisation and testing a Support Vector Machine has been chosen. This has been integrated with the Infandango system, providing a visual mechanism to display the cumulative feedback to the student.}

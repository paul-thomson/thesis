\label{introduction}
Infandango is an open source web-based system for automated grading of Java code submitted by students\cite{infandango_note}. The aim of this project is to improve the feedback provided to students by using machine learning methods to display a visual representation of their current progress. In chapter \ref{design} the design process will be discussed, justifying primary aspects of the design. Chapter \ref{machinelearning} will be reserved for discussing the process through which the final model was chosen, documenting the results of various analyses. Implementation of the feedback device with the current Infandango system will be explained in Chapter \ref{implementation} and the report will end with a conclusion and summary of the work.
